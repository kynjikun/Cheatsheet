Creating Systemd Services and Timers(Basic)
------------------------------------------

Systemd Service
- make your custom shell script/app available under command `systemctl`

<filename>.service
==================

[Unit]
Description=this value will be shown when using command `systemctl status <filename>.service`

[Service]
Type=oneshot
ExecStart=<path/to/shell/script>.sh
User=<user of the .sh file>
Group=<user of the .sh file>

Systemd Timer
- used in conjunction with Systemd Service, works like crontab that triggers/runs scripts based on the schedule

<filename>.timer
================

[Unit]
Description=this value will be shown when using command `systemctl status <filename>.timer`

[Timer]
OnCalendar=Mon..Fri 00:00:00
Unit=<filename>.service

[Install]
WantedBy=timers.target

** note
both of these file should be under <path/to/systemd/system/*> for it be readable

run `sudo systemctl daemon-reload` command to make the custom service and timer to be recognized by systemctl.
commands like systemctl start, stop, enable, disable, status, etc. should now be usable for the service and timer.
